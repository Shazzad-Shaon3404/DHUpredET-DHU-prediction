## ‚è© Highlight Feature Categories

This study proposes a robust approach for developing a DHUpredET model. The approach utilizes a comprehensive feature extraction strategy, leveraging features from four descriptors:

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based**:
These features capture the sequential and semantic information within the sequences using techniques like **FastText, Bert, LSA, and Doc2vec**.

### **Physicochemical-based**:
These features encode the physical and chemical properties of the residues, captured by methods like **PseEIIP and DPCP**.

### **Residue composition-based**: 
These features describe the overall composition of the sequences in terms of residue types, represented by **Z-curve features**.

### **Nucleic amino acid composition-based**:
These features capture specific information related to the amino acid composition of nucleic acids, utilizing methods like **RNA binary and PS2 features**.

## Hyperparameter Tuning Explanation

- **n_estimators (100)**: This sets the number of decision trees in the forest. Tuning this value can impact model complexity and accuracy.
- **random_state (10)**: This controls the randomness for tree generation, ensuring reproducibility when set to a fixed value.
- **max_depth (None)**: This allows trees to grow to their maximum depth without restriction.
- **min_samples_split (4)**: This defines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Tuning this can influence model overfitting.
- **min_samples_leaf (1)**: This sets the minimum number of samples allowed in a leaf node. Increasing it can prevent overfitting.
- **max_features ('auto')**: This considers all features for tree splitting by default.
- **bootstrap (False)**: This means each tree uses the entire dataset for training.
- **criterion ('gini')**: This uses the Gini impurity measure for tree splitting. It can be compared with other criteria like entropy.
